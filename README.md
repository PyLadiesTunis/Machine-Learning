We were happy to organize the 4th meetup of the Data Science From Zero to Hero series in collaboration with [IEEE WIE Esprit](https://www.facebook.com/IEEE.WIE.ESPRIT): Build a Machine Learning Model with Python (https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/events/283602578/). We were pleased to be hosting [Vivek Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-sharma-2715b6129/). 

‚û°Ô∏è Workshop description:

Machine learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, ML has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
In this workshop, you will learn about the fundamentals of ML and the different ML algorithms used in data science.
